Installation process:
- Installing the SDK is laid out pretty well in the docs, but I ran into a problem with a required library: aiogrpc version 1.4 or greater. The solution was just to upgrade my Python version to be Python 3.6 or above.

It does look like vector works without the phone attached, which is very nice. The problem is that it seems like it works over the network the computer is on. I don't have a vector to test this, but I worry that this may not work on the MWireless network because of its size, and because Vector may struggle to even connect to MWireless due to the logon issues.

Just looking at the API, there does look to be some fairly siginificant differences. Again, I don't have Vector to test stuff on, but I'd bet that Cozmo code would need a decent amount of modification to work with Vector. The biggest differences I've noticed (so far) are the way you create a Robot object, which is the primary interface to the Cozmo/Vector, and the way you issue commands to the Vector. These are pretty integral components, and the fact they they differ in a meaningful way makes me suspect that there will be many other, smaller differences as well.
